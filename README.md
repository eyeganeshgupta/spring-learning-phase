## Introduction

The Spring Framework is a powerful, feature-rich framework for building Java applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, enabling developers to focus on the application's business logic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Maven or Gradle
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (I'm using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2024.1.4)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eyeganeshgupta/spring-learning-phase.git
    cd learning-spring-framework
    ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

   Or, if you are using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

## Core Concepts

1. **Dependency Injection**: Spring's fundamental feature to manage object creation and dependencies.
2. **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
3. **Spring MVC**: A model-view-controller framework for web applications.
4. **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies the implementation of data access layers by reducing the boilerplate code required for database interactions.
5. **Spring Security**: Provides comprehensive security services for Java applications.
