    ðŸ“Œ Using @Bean Annotation
        ðŸ‘‰ The @Bean annotation is a method level annotation.
        ðŸ‘‰ When we apply this on a method then it indicates that the method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
        ðŸ‘‰ It is typically used in classes annotated with @Configuration, but it can also be used in other contexts.
