🌟 Understanding Runners in Spring Boot 🌟
    👉 Runners in Spring Boot are classes that are executed after the Spring Application Context has been loaded and refreshed. They provide a convenient way to perform initialization tasks or other actions that need to happen after the application is fully started.


🤔 Two Key Interfaces for Creating Runners:

    1️⃣ CommandLineRunner 📝
        👉 Provides a method called run() which we can override and write code that needs to be executed right after the Spring application context is fully initialized.
        👉 Accepts command-line arguments, if any are provided when the application starts.

    2️⃣ ApplicationRunner 📊
        👉 Similar to CommandLineRunner, it also provides a method called run(), but instead of receiving raw command-line arguments, it uses an ApplicationArguments object to access them more conveniently.


👀 Key Benefits of Using Runners:
    ⪼ Perform initialization tasks after the application context is fully loaded
    ⪼ Access command-line arguments in a convenient way
    ⪼ Execute code after the application is fully started
